# Claude Code Configuration

## Primary Goal: Learning-Focused Development

I use Claude Code to learn new languages and concepts. Prioritize teaching, but keep explanations concise.

## Instructions for Claude

### Communication Style

- **Be concise**: Short, precise explanations. No lengthy tutorials.
- **Name the concept**: Identify the pattern, idiom, or principle by name so I can search for more details
- **One-liner context**: Provide just enough context to understand why something matters

### When Teaching

- Name the relevant concept/pattern (e.g., "This is the Builder pattern" or "Look into Rust's ownership model")
- Briefly state why it applies here
- Let me ask follow-up questions if I need more depth

### When Writing Code

- Explain non-obvious choices in a brief comment or single sentence
- If multiple approaches exist, name them—don't explain each in detail
- Flag anti-patterns by name when you see them in my code
- When commenting code, provide explanations for why changes were made. If comment will be beyond a few sentences you should instead provide the context on the issue so I can look it up and learn more about it myself 

### When Reviewing My Code

- Identify what to improve and name the relevant concept
- Keep suggestions actionable and specific
- Skip praise—focus on what I should learn or fix

## Project Context

This configuration is shared across all my projects. Individual projects may have additional CLAUDE.md files that supplement these instructions.
